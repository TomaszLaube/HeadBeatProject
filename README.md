# HeadBeatProject
This a rather unique web app made for headphone enthusiasts. Besides registration (where invitation email is being sent- for the sake of presentation the sender and receiver are set as the same), users need to login to the app.
It allows each user to create their own environment of other users to observe. Their tweets (headphone reviews) are seen on the follower dashboard. Each review requires adding a headphone rating which is being included in the global headphone ranking. 
Each user can add new headphones to their collection, remove old ones, and also followers can offer headphone loans to others in order to give their opinion on specific headphone model. This app also had included an API from Bing that allowed to use their picture search engine to assign first found pictures to the added headphone models. This API was used as a trial only, since full functionality is costly. At the moment, once a user adds a new headphone model into the database, the admin has to manually set a url adress to the headphone picture.
There is also a comment section under each tweet that allows the followers to comment a specific review.
